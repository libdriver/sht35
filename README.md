## LibDriver SHT35

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/sht35/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

SHT35 is the next generation of Sensirion's temperature and humidity sensors. It builds on a new CMOSens sensor chip that is at the heart of Sensirion's new humidity and temperature platform. The SHT35 has increased intelligence, reliability and improved accuracy specifications compared to its predecessor. Its functionality includes enhanced signal processing, two distinctive and user selectable IIC addresses and communication speeds of up to 1 MHz. The DFN package has a footprint of 2.5 x 2.5 mm2 while keeping a height of 0.9 mm. This allows for integration of the SHT35 into a great variety of applications. Additionally, the wide supply voltage range of 2.4 V to 5.5 V guarantees compatibility with diverse assembly situations. All in all, the SHT35 incorporates 15 years of knowledge of Sensirion, the leader in the humidity sensor industry.

LibDriver SHT35 is the full function driver of SHT35 launched by LibDriver.It provides functions of temperature and humidity continuous mode reading and temperature and humidity single mode reading. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver SHT35 source files.

/interface includes LibDriver SHT35 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver SHT35 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver SHT35 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver SHT35 offline document.

/datasheet includes SHT35 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_sht35_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float temperature;
float humidity;

res = sht35_basic_init(SHT35_ADDRESS_0);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    sht35_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = sht35_basic_read((float *)&temperature, (float *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)sht35_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    sht35_interface_debug_print("sht35: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    sht35_interface_debug_print("sht35: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)sht35_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example shot

```C
#include "driver_sht35_shot.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float temperature;
float humidity;

res = sht35_shot_init(SHT35_ADDRESS_0);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    sht35_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = sht35_shot_read((float *)&temperature, (float *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)sht35_shot_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    sht35_interface_debug_print("sht35: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    sht35_interface_debug_print("sht35: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)sht35_shot_deinit();

return 0;
```
